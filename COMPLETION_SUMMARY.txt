# ✅ YEAR LEVEL IMPLEMENTATION - COMPLETE

## What Was Done

Your faculty feedback system has been successfully updated with:

### 1. ✅ Year Level Support (FY, SY, TY, Final Year)
- Added `year_level` column to faculty table
- Added `year_level` column to feedback table
- 4 academic year levels now supported

### 2. ✅ Faculty Separation by Year
- Each faculty member assigned to a specific year level
- Students see only faculty teaching their year
- Faculty can teach different years (handled separately)

### 3. ✅ Engineering Branch Filtering
- Existing branch/department filtering continues
- Combined with year level filtering
- Students select: Year → Branch → Faculty (in that order)

### 4. ✅ Updated Student Feedback Form
- NEW: Year Level selector (FY, SY, TY, Final Year) at top
- EXISTING: Branch selector
- UPDATED: Faculty dropdown filtered by both year and branch
- UNCHANGED: Rating criteria (Q1-Q5) and overall rating

### 5. ✅ Updated Admin Dashboard
- Faculty statistics now show: Name | Department | Year Level | Responses | Rating
- Recent submissions include year level information
- CSV export includes year level column

### 6. ✅ Database Reset Script
- New script: `reset_db_with_years.py`
- Backs up old database automatically
- Creates 8 sample faculty across all years and departments
- Creates demo accounts (admin/student)

## 🚀 How to Use

### Step 1: Reset Database
```bash
cd c:\Users\ho\Desktop\Feedback
C:/Users/ho/Desktop/Feedback/venv/Scripts/python.exe reset_db_with_years.py
```

Output will show:
```
✓ Existing database backed up to feedback_streamlit.db.backup
✓ All tables dropped
✓ All tables created with new schema
✓ 8 faculty members added
✓ Admin account created
✓ Student account created
✓✓✓ Database reset complete! ✓✓✓
```

### Step 2: Start Application
```bash
C:/Users/ho/Desktop/Feedback/venv/Scripts/python.exe -m streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

### Step 3: Open in Browser
- App will open at `http://localhost:8501`
- Or open manually in browser

### Step 4: Login & Test
- **Admin:** admin / admin123
- **Student:** student / student123

## 🎓 Example Usage

### Student (FY, Computer Science)
1. Select Year: FY
2. Select Branch: Computer Science
3. Faculty dropdown shows:
   - Dr. Rajesh Kumar (CS, FY) ✓
   - Dr. Rajesh Desai is filtered out (CS but TY) ✗
4. Provides feedback for Dr. Rajesh Kumar
5. Feedback stored with year_level = "FY"

### Admin View
1. Sees in dashboard that Dr. Rajesh Kumar:
   - Department: Computer Science
   - Year Level: FY
   - 5 responses, 8.2/10 average rating
2. Can analyze FY feedback separately from TY
3. Exports CSV with year level for analysis

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

**Q: Faculty not showing in dropdown?**
A: Make sure you selected a year level first. Year level is required.

**Q: Old database causing issues?**
A: Run reset script again, it automatically backs up old data.

**Q: Packages missing?**
A: Run: `pip install streamlit pandas numpy matplotlib openpyxl`

## 📝 Next Steps

1. ✅ Run the reset script
2. ✅ Start the application
3. ✅ Test student feedback with year selection
4. ✅ View admin dashboard
5. ✅ Export and check CSV
6. ✅ Replace sample faculty with your actual faculty
7. ✅ Deploy to Streamlit Cloud (optional)
